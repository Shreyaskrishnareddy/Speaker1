**Speaker1**

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for document analysis and semantic search using OpenAI and Pinecone.

## üìã What's Included

- **Document Analysis**: Perform analysis on various document formats using OpenAI's language model.
- **Semantic Search**: Leverage Pinecone's vector database for efficient semantic search and retrieval of relevant documents.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Utilize OpenAI's embeddings to generate dense vector representations of documents.
- **Document Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant documents based on user queries and perform ranking using Pinecone's database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with Speaker1, please install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install langchain openai pinecone
```

## üìä Usage

### Setting up the environment

1. Initialize the Pinecone environment by creating an account and setting up your API keys.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip.
3. Configure your OpenAI API keys and Pinecone API keys in the `config.py` file.

### Running the application

1. Run the following command to start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```
2. Use the provided API endpoints to interact with the RAG system.

### Example API Endpoints

- **/search**: Perform a semantic search on a given query.
- **/analyze**: Analyze a document and retrieve its vector embedding.
